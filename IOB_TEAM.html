          <td><p><strong>Dr. Babylakshmi Muthusamy </strong>obtained her Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics from the Institute of Bioinformatics, Bangalore and Pondicherry University. She has extensive experience in analyzing mass spectrometry-based proteomic data, proteogenomics and next generation sequencing data. She carried out her thesis work on analysis of next generation sequencing data for studying inherited genetic disorders. She was involved in the identification of genes associated with X-linked intellectual disability, primary immunodeficiency and schizophrenia. She is a recipient of DBT-BioCARe Women Scientist Award. Her current work involves analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data derived from next generation sequencing platforms to study inherited genetic disorders and microbial diagnostics.
